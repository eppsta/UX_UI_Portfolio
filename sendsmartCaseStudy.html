After further investigation, it became apparent the goals and needs of users depended upon their job title / position. As a result, <strong>six dealership representatives were considered across three different personas, averaging only two reps per persona</strong>. Due to there being a low sample size, <strong>conclusions about the personas may not generalize as hoped</strong>.</p></div>

While this method allowed data to be collected in a short period of time, it may have <strong>come at the cost of having a more holistic view of dealerships and the processes they implement</strong>. It could be the case that pain points one dealership experiences when using SendSmart aren’t the same pain points of another dealership. Once again, <strong>findings may not be as generalized as hoped</strong>.</p></div>
