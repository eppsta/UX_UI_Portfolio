            <div class = "descriptionHeading"><p>I'm NOT the User</p></div>
            <div class = "sectionDescription"><p>My motivation for taking on HBO Max as a project was the result of my use of the application. While I initially considered myself a user, the more in-depth my involvement became in improving the design of the app, the less I was able to seperate myself from the design process. To keep my own biases at bay, it became increasingly important to no longer consider myself a user of the product, and instead, to defer to others who use the app to better understand their needs.</p></div>
       
            <div class = "descriptionHeading"><p>Drawing from a Representative Sample</p></div>
            <div class = "sectionDescription"><p>There are limitations to consider when analyzing the methods used for user research conducted at the beginning of the project as well as the outcomes found during the usability testing. The participants used for both research and testing were conventiently generated by turning to those in my network. As a result, it could be argued that the findings from this project do not generalize to as large of a userbase as hoped. Further research and testing should be conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design solutions found in this case study.</p></div>

            <div class = "descriptionHeading"><p>Usability Testing: Translating to a Real-World Setting</p></div>
            <div class = "sectionDescription"><p>When performing an experiment or testing an application, it’s important to consider the medium in which it’s being conducted, and how it might differ in a real-world setting. HBO Max in this project was redesigned for a TV app, something that utilizes a either game controller or a TV remote as a means for navigating the application. However, when it came to testing the redesign, it was perfomed remotely on a laptop using a keyboard. While it’s possible the outcome may not have been significantly impacted by this medium, it’s important to try and replicate a real-world setting as much as possible to minimize the degree in which these differences could impact the results.</p></div>

            <div class = "sectionDescription"><p>As mentioned before, further research and testing need to be performed to confirm whether the design solutions in this case study merit further development. To do this, steps should taken to ensure the sample of participants being considered adequetly represent the larger user base being targeted.</p></div>
